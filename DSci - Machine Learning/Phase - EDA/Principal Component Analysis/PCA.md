Part of Dimensionality Reduction and is used to reduce features to the most predictive/valuable

# Dimensionality Reduction
Many techniques to reduce the number of dimensions but most commonly used are:




- Feature Elimination:
   - Eliminate/drop any features which increase model time but offer no value
   - Eliminate 

## Feature Extraction


> often used to visualize genetic distance and relatedness between populations. PCA is either done by **singular value decomposition of a design matrix** or by doing the following 2 steps:
1. calculating the data covariance (or correlation) matrix of the original data
1. performing **eigenvalue decomposition** on the covariance matrix
