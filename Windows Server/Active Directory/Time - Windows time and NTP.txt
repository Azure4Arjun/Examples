Windows Time on a PDC, DC member servers, net time 

Errors we've seen that require fixing the time:
* Kerberos tickets being out of sync
* Unable to RDP to servers because of error message "There is a time and/or date difference between the client and server"

Root cause is that a member server is "more than 5 minutes out of sync" with the PDC.
Which means you'll be able to RDP to any server whose logonserver was the PDC, but unable to RDP to any server that logged on to a member DC.

PDC must not be configured to sync with itself

/***************************************************
Troubleshooting time issues on a Windows domain:
***************************************************/

Background you need to know:
* PDC for domain is configured to be a forest DC 
* It is configured to use an external time source (usually NIST or Rackspace time servers)
* The member DCs are all configured to use the PDC as authoritative time source 
* If any member DC gets out of sync by more than 5 minutes to the PDC, the any member servers that logged on using this member DC will not allow you to RDP
* You will still be able to RDP to any member server that was logged on by the PDC, and you will still be able to RDP to the PDC and possibly the member DCs 
* The member servers that you cannot RDP to are "fine" - they will continue to work as normal for background operations
* NTP and NT5DS are the two "types" of time protocols:
	- configure the PDC to be NT5DS 
	- configure the member DCs to be NTP
* The Microsoft documentation is not accurate: "How to configure an authoritative time server" 
	- https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/816042/how-to-configure-an-authoritative-time-server-in-windows-server
	- It says to configure the PDC to be NTP - that does not work; it has to be NT5DS 
	
When these errors happen, the most likely explanation is that:
	- (a) the PDC has "lost" its memory of the external time sources
	- (b) *and* the member servers get confused because they think they might be out of sync
	- (c) the time service itself is wonky and "just stops working, or forgets its settings" sometimes and there's nothing you can do to prevent its
	- (d) you need to have documented "Here's what our time settings should be, and here's how to reset them" in the event the PDC barfs and forgets its time config 
	
To verify this is the problem:

/****** Start with the PDC **********/
The PDC is the most likely issue - verify it 

1. RDP to the PDC - you will be able to log on to it since it's "time" is considered by it to be "the authority".
2. Launch a command prompt as admin 

3. Review the registry settings (which is where the PDC pulls the external time servers from)
	- from HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\W32Time\

w32tm /dumpreg /subkey:parameters

Verify that you see the following keys:

Value Name                 Value Type          Value Data
------------------------------------------------------------

ServiceDllUnloadOnStop     REG_DWORD           1
ServiceMain                REG_SZ              SvchostEntry_W32Time
ServiceDll                 REG_EXPAND_SZ       C:\Windows\system32\w32time.DLL
Type                       REG_SZ              NT5DS
NtpServer                  REG_SZ              time.ord1.rackspace.com, time2.ord1.rackspace.com (or the nist time servers, etc)

This is "what the registry says this PDC should be using for the time" 

4. Document the above - I like to pipe the results to | clip and paste to a new text file, or just screenshot

5. Verify that the PDC is actually *using* the registry information:

w32tm /query /source 

You should see one of the external time servers listed in Step 3. If you do, all is good! The PDC is not the problem - proceed to logging on to a member DC and troubleshooting.

If you do NOT see the external time server (there's only one that it returns - that's the one it is "using" for sync), you will see:
Free-running system clock 
Local CMOS clock 

These are errors - this is how you know the PDC has "lost" it's time settings. It is NOT using what the registry said to use! 

6. If the PDC is not using the external time servers, make sure you backup everything in the registry (particularly the w32tm key). You are about to delete the w32tm key entirely from the registry, and you will have to completely re-do it. 

7. Stop and restart the "Windows Time Service" 
net Stop W32time
net Start W32time
w32tm /query /source 

Did you fix it? Yes? Hooray! You are done. Didn't fix it? Time for drastic changes...

8. Did you backup the w32tm registry key? Seriously - you need to do that before continuing.

9. Delete the w32tm information:
# /unregister deletes the w32tm configuration and thus deletes your external time server configuration 
# / register adds the w32tm key back, but it no longer uses an external time server - you'll need to configure that next
net Stop W32time
W32tm.exe /unregister
W32tm.exe /register
net Start W32time

10. Open the registry editor (yes you can powershell/command prompt too) and browse to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\W32Time\Parameters
	- If there is an entry for NtpServer, change it to be "time.ord1.rackspace.com, time2.ord1.rackspace.com" (or the nist time servers, etc)
	- If there is not an entry for NtpServer, add a new String Value named NtpServer and set the value to "time.ord1.rackspace.com, time2.ord1.rackspace.com" (no quotes though)


w32tm /query /source 

Did you fix it? It should - this was the nuclear option. BTW - /source will only return one of the time servers, that's just showing you which of the entries you entered it is currently synching with.

# how to find what domain controller authenticated this server
echo %logonserver%

To review NTP settings quickly:
w32tm /dumpreg /subkey:parameters

To force NTP Sync, this requires elevation:
W32tm /resync /force


             
MUST run as admin - otherwise it sometimes generates an ICMP error:
servername.mywindowsdomain.com[[::1]:123]:
    ICMP: error 0x8007271D

    which is a space-delimited list of DNS and/or IP addresses.
    When specifying multiple peers, this switch must be enclosed in
    quotes.
  syncfromflags:<source> - sets what sources the NTP client should
    sync from. <source> should be a comma separated list of
    these keywords (not case sensitive):
      MANUAL - sync from peers in the manual peer list
      DOMHIER - sync from an AD DC in the domain hierarchy
      NO - sync from none
      ALL - sync from both manual and domain peers
