**If the reviews are marked "Members (self)", who can review?**
- Only the creating member (a.k.a. self-reviews)


**If the reviewer does not respond by the end date, then what?**
- Depends on the Auto apply and the "Should reviewer not respond" values
- Should reviewer not respond options:
    - No change - leave the user's access unchanged
    - Remove access - remove the user's access
    - Approve access
    - Take recommendations - take the system's recommendation (which is generally "Send an email")
