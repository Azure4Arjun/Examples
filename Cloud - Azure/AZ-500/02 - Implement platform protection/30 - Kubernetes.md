# Kubernetes

- Kubernetes provides a declarative approach to deployments, backed by a robust set of APIs for management operations.
- Kubernetes supports both stateless and stateful applications as teams progress through the adoption of microservices-based applications

# Kubernetes cluster architecture

Two components:
- **Control plane nodes** provide the core Kubernetes services and orchestration of application workloads
- **Nodes** run your application workloads
