# Traffic Manager Routing
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/traffic-manager/traffic-manager-routing-methods
  
There are **six routing methods available**
1. Priority - use when you have 1 primary, 1 secondary location to route to
1. Weighted - load balance based on user-defined weights
1. Performance - geographic least latency / closest
1. Geographic - use for compliance w local laws. **Generally not recommended - use nested profiles instead**
1. Multivalue - returns multiple DNS entries to end user. Use if you want a customer to be able to choose IPv4/IPv6 endpoint for same resource (i.e. it gives option for both to end user)
1. Subnet - route specific users to specific endpoints

**What can TM route?** - anything on public internet; not usable within a vnet/private network

**Sticky sessions?** - this is DNS so no. Besides, th source IP received by TM is the Recursive DNS service, not the customer/end user

**What is a nested profile and why?**
  - MSFT recommends against Geographic routing and prefers nested routes [in this FAQ document](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/traffic-manager/traffic-manager-faqs)
  - Why? 
      - A region can be assigned to only one endpoint within a profile if it is using the geographic routing method.
      - If that endpoint is unavailable, Traffic Manager does not failover to another endpoint 
      - Nested profiles mitigate this by allowing both geographic routing but multiple endpoints + auto failover

**What is Real User Measurements?** - social latency; customers data tracked to speed up future queries

**What routing profiles support this?** - Only performance routing

**Where do I enable?** - Subscription level, not TM

**How?** - Embed javascript generated by TM into web app

# High Availability / DR / BC w Traffic Manager

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/traffic-manager/traffic-manager-routing-methods#priority

Use **Priority Traffic-Routing Method**

> The Traffic Manager profile contains a prioritized list of service endpoints. **By default, Traffic Manager sends all traffic to the primary (highest-priority) endpoint** 
> **If the primary endpoint is not available, Traffic Manager routes the traffic to the second endpoint**
> If both the primary and secondary endpoints are not available, the traffic goes to the third, and so on. 
< Availability of the endpoint is based on the configured status (enabled or disabled) and the ongoing endpoint monitoring.
