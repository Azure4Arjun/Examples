# 1. Setup Guide Overview

Uses the [Azure setup guide](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Resources/QuickstartPlaybookBlade/guideId/intro-azure-setup)

# 2. Organize Resources

## Resource Groups 

What belongs in a resource group? 
- Things w same lifecycle
- Things w same lock requirements
- Things you want to control permissions to on a group basis (vs. individual resource permissions)

Why do resource groups have to define a region? 
- This is where the metadata for that region is defined

## Subscriptions

Why would I have different subsriptions?
- DEV, STG, PROD, DR
- To bypass [limits of the Azure platform](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/azure-subscription-service-limits)
- To separate billing by department/app/etc
