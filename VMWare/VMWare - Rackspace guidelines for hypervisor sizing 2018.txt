VCPUS
In production environments, Rackspace supports using 3 vCPUs for 1 physical CPU; however, we realize that other environments, such as test environments, can run at higher ratios with little business risk. Once you have exceeded the 1:1 ratio, it is highly recommended that you review your performances graphs for at least the last 30 days before adding additional resources.

The vCPUs text shows the number of vCPUs you have available, after using the 3:1 virtual-to-physical ratio. The text will be green when you have additional resources available. The text will be red when your solution is over allocated.

Here are the rules we use to determine vCPUs text colors:

Total vCPUs = 3 x Physical CPUs
Available vCPUs = Total vCPUs - Allocated vCPUs
When Available vCPUs is not negative, the text is green; otherwise, it is red.
VRAM
In production environments, Rackspace supports using 1.25 vRAM to 1 physical RAM; however, we realize that other environments, such as test environments, can run at higher ratios with little business risk. Once you have exceeded the 1:1 ratio, it is highly recommended that you review your performances graphs for at least the last 30 days before adding additional resources.

The vRAM text shows the amount of vRAM you have available, after using the 1.25:1 virtual-to-physical ratio. The text will be green when you have additional resources available. The text will be red when your solution is over allocated.

Here are the rules we use to determine vRAM text colors:

Total vRAM = 1.25 x Physical RAM
Available vRAM = Total vRAM - Allocated vRAM
When Available vRAM is not negative, the text is green; otherwise, it is red.
