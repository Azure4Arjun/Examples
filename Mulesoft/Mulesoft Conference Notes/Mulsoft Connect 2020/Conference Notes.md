## Digital imperative: moving faster than ever before
**It's business unusual for all of our customers**

Many hidden opportunities in current crisis - Things are now suddenly very different, and one key thing is that people are much more willing to try something new. 

With more WFH, no more "swivel chair IT" - where developers can turn around, ask for something, and IT delivers. Now we need more self-service software. 

**Anything that can run remotely should be ready to run remotely** - this drastically elevates the value of IT

## Key change: "Everyone, all at once"
IT cannot keep up with all the requests - used to be able to prioritize, but now every department is overwhelming IT with requests all at once.
* Find a way to provide self tools that allow people to "do more on their own" without fear of "making a mess" or "making a mistake"
