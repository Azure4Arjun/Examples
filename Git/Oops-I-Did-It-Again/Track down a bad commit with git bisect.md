When you have a broken commit, you have two choices:
1. Manually inspect and go through each recent commit by hand to identify the bad commit
2. Have `git bisect` do the dirty work for you and quickly tell you which commit is bad

Git bisect uses a **binary search** to find the broken commit. 
> Binary search is an efficient algorithm for finding an item from a sorted list of items. 
> It works by repeatedly dividing in half the portion of the list that could contain the 
> item, until youâ€™ve narrowed down the possible locations to just one.

Step 1: `git bisect start` will start the 'wizard'. If you need to exit early, do so with `git bisect reset`

Step 2: If you know the bad commit, go ahead and enter it: 
`git bisect bad <commit>`. If you need Git to find it for you,
 just leave the `<commit>` blank. Use `git log` to find the
commits. 

Step 3: Find the last known good commit and run `git bisect good <commit>`

```shell
Bisecting: 49 revisions left to test after this (roughly 9 steps)
[d0b028f205a78ecc748e69d62450b4a804784da9] mb/google/cyan: Adjust 
ACPI interrupt triggering for audio codecs
```
In the above, our last know good commit was 49 commits ago and `git bisect` 
is now going through each of the more recent commits
to find the bad commit.
