When you have a broken commit, you have two choices:
1. Manually inspect and go through each recent commit by hand to identify the bad commit
2. Have `git bisect` do the dirty work for you and quickly tell you which commit is bad

Git bisect uses a **binary search** to find the broken commit. 
> Binary search is an efficient algorithm for finding an item from a sorted list of items. 
> It works by repeatedly dividing in half the portion of the list that could contain the 
> item, until youâ€™ve narrowed down the possible locations to just one.
