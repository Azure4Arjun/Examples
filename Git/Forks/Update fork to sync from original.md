1. Open your fork of the repository.
2. Click the compare button (to the right)
3. In the next page, you will see no changes (most likely). Switch the forks by clicking on `switching the base` link
4. You will now see the changes made in the original fork compared to your forked copy. Click on `Create pull request`
5. Now you can see the changes in the original since you forked it. If you just want to update your forked copy, approve and merge the PR. 

Your forked copy is now up to date with the original
