So many different words for the same thing - hard to wrap your head around it at first. I think
best choice is to start with [Stevens' Typology of Variable Classification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_of_measurement)
and learn that "way of thinking" first, then start branching out into some of the other words/naming used
in tech/python/R/forums/office talk. 

From [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_of_measurement):
>**Level of measurement** or **scale of measure** is a classification that describes the nature of information within the values assigned to variables. Psychologist Stanley Smith Stevens developed the **best-known classification** with four levels, or scales, of measurement: nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio. This framework of distinguishing levels of measurement originated in psychology and is widely criticized by scholars in other disciplines. Other classifications include those by Mosteller and **Tukey**, and by Chrisman.

>Stevens proposed his typology in a **1946 Science article titled “On the theory of scales of measurement”**. In that article, Stevens claimed that *all measurement in science was conducted using four different types of scales that he called “nominal”, “ordinal”, “interval”, and “ratio”, unifying both “qualitative” (which are described by his “nominal” type) and “quantitative”)* to a different degree, all the rest of his scales).
