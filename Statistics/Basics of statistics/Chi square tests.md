Two types of chi-square tests and both use the chi-square statistic and distribution for different purposes:

A chi-square goodness of fit test determines if a sample data matches a population. For more details on this type, see: Goodness of Fit Test.
A chi-square test for independence compares two variables in a contingency table to see if they are related. In a more general sense, it tests to see whether distributions of categorical variables differ from each another.
A very small chi square test statistic means that your observed data fits your expected data extremely well. In other words, there is a relationship.
A very large chi square test statistic means that the data does not fit very well. In other words, there isnâ€™t a relationship.
