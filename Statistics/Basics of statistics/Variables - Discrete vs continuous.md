# Discrete data points
Discrete data involves round, concrete numbers that are determined by counting. Discrete data relates to individual, countable items.
Some synonyms for the word “discrete” include: disconnected, separate and distinct. 

`A fun rule of thumb is that, in many cases, discrete data can be preceded by “the number of.”`

# Continuous data points
Continuous data involves complex numbers that are measured across a specific time interval.

A simple way to describe the difference between the two is to visualize a scatter plot graph vs. a line graph.

# Quiz - Discrete or continuous?
** You record a log of how many push-ups per day you could achieve for 30 days **
Discrete because (a) you are recording a counting of things that (b) cannot be broken into smaller parts. You don't count a half a push-up - it's a discrete value that can't be broken down further.
