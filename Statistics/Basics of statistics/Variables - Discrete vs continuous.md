# Discrete data points
Discrete data involves round, concrete numbers that are determined by counting. Discrete data relates to individual, countable items.
Some synonyms for the word “discrete” include: disconnected, separate and distinct. 

# Continuous data points
Continuous data involves complex numbers that are measured across a specific time interval.

A simple way to describe the difference between the two is to visualize a scatter plot graph vs. a line graph.
