Linear regression is a statistical model that examines the linear relationship between two (Simple Linear Regression ) 
or more (Multiple Linear Regression) variables â€” a dependent variable and independent variable(s). 
Linear relationship basically means that when one (or more) independent variables increases (or decreases), 
the dependent variable increases (or decreases) in tandem.
