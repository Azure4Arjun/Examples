Linear regression is a statistical model that examines the linear relationship between two (Simple Linear Regression ) 
or more (Multiple Linear Regression) variables — a dependent variable and independent variable(s). 
Linear relationship basically means that when one (or more) independent variables increases (or decreases), 
the dependent variable increases (or decreases) in tandem.
* [Simple linear regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_linear_regression) typically uses OLS ([Ordinary Least Squares](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinary_least_squares)

The relationship between variables "Y" and "X" is represented by this equation: ![x](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/968be557dd22b1a2e536b8d22369cfdb37f58703)
* X is the independent variable — the variable we are using to make predictions
* Y is the dependent variable (the variable we are trying to predict)
* m is the slope of the regression line — it represent the effect X has on Y. In other words, if X increases by 1 unit, Y will increase by exactly m units. 
* b is a constant, also known as the Y-intercept. If X equals 0, Y would be equal to b . This is not necessarily applicable in real life
