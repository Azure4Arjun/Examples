**reflogs** (a.k.a. reference logs) are how git logs the changes to branches, workspaces, and stashes
- Every time your branch tip is updated **for any reason** (by switching branches, pulling in new changes, rewriting history or simply by adding new commits), a new entry will be added to the reflog.


`git reflog`
