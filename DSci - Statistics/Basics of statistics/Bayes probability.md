**Bayes probability** is a data analysis technique that uses prior probabilities and test
information to create posterior (after the fact) probabilities

Named after the statistician Rev. Thomas Bayes who provided an equation that basically allows new information to update the outcome of a probability calculation. The rule is also called the Bayes-Price rule after the mathematician Richard Price, as he recognized the importance of the theorem, made some corrections to Bayesâ€™ work and put the rule to use.

**Naive Bayes classifiers** predict but ignore the relationships between the predictor variables themselves
