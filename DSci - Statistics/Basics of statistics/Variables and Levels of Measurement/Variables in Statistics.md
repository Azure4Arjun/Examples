> A variable is **any characteristics, number, or quantity that can be measured or counted**.
>It is called a variable because the value may vary between data units in a population, and may change in value over time. 
> ‘income’ is a variable that can vary between data units in a population (i.e. the people or businesses being studied may not have the same incomes) and can also vary over time for each data unit (i.e. income can go up or down). 

What are the types of variables,
[This page lists over 75 types](https://www.statisticshowto.com/probability-and-statistics/types-of-variables/) however generally most data scientists today will use a handful (below).  Variables are classified based on the arithmetic operations that “make sense” with the data (and there’s a difference between “data where addition and subtraction make sense” vs “data where multiplication and division make sense”)
* **Categorical variables** can be either **Nominal** (=, !=, IN(), NOT IN()) or ** Ordinal** (>, <)
  - Nominal = "names"
  - Ordinal = "ranks"
  - Boolean = dichotomous (Y/N, Off/On, Churn/Stay)
* **Numerical variables** can be either **continuous** (+, -) or **discrete** (*, /) and manifest as **integers** or **floating point** / decimals
