Two options:
- Option 1: Move to a new folder on the same drive 
- Option 2: Move to a different drive

# Option 1: Move to a new folder on the same drive 

This is all done within Lightroom.
1. Lightroom Library - Folders - Add (+)
2. Open the folder in Library, select all photos, drag them to the new folder

# Option 2: Move to a different drive

This is a combination of Lightroom and file copy or move

1. Cut/paste the folder to the new drive
2. Launch Lightroom and go to the folder. It now has a question mark
3. Right click and select "Find missing folder", then navigate to the new location
