# Four Vs of Big Data

Big four Vâ€™s of big data - **can be any one or any combination of the below**

* Volume: Big data is always large in terms of volume. Some have predicted that the amount of data generated in the last 
two years is more than what has been created before that throughout human history. 2019: projected that 2.3 *trillion* 
GB of data are generated each day.
* Variety: The endless variety of data is more impressive than its sheer volume. The diversity is not only regarding 
devices or sources of data generation but also the type of data, along with structured and unstructured data. Data is 
generated through laptops, fitness trackers, tablets, smartphones, supercomputers, and many other mediums. One of the 
most substantial sources is social media platforms with Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram producing more data than any 
other communication tools. At present, data scientists are more inquisitive about unstructured data, which can be in 
the form of social media comment, voice recording, or media files. Using machine learning techniques and natural 
language processing, data scientists can understand customer behavior.
* Velocity: The frequency of incoming data is also increasing each day. For example, many reports published on what 
happens in an internet second show overwhelming numbers. In an internet second, more than 50,000 Google searches are 
completed, more than 125,000 YouTube videos are viewed, 7,000 tweets are sent out, and more than 2 million emails 
are sent. The flow of data is huge and constant, which can help researchers and companies to make valuable decisions.
