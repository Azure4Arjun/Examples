Bootstrap: https://getbootstrap.com

* Visualize bootstrap as 12-slot containers that you can split up anyway you want

### Structure
1. HTML and meta tags
2.    div class="container"
3.         div class="row"
4.             div class="col" (along with how many columns of the 12 flexbox model) it should take up

The *row* is the 12-box system (not the container)
