# Examples
My code samples and scripts that I use to hopefully save time in the future. Some may be wrong, as they might represent "what I knew at the time"!

## Array syntax
JavaScript: `var myArray = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25];`

Python: `myArray = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25];`

## Dictionary syntax
JavaScript: `var myDict = {"Name": "Scott", "State": "TX"};`

Python: `myDict = {"Name": "Scott", "State": "TX"};`
