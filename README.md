# Examples
My code samples and scripts that I use to hopefully save time in the future. Some may be wrong, as they might represent "what I knew at the time"!

## Array syntax
### JavaScript: 
// Basic:
`var myArray = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25];`

// Nested
`var nested = {
    "hello":{
        "english":"hello",
        "french":"bonjour",
        "portuguese":"ola"
    },
    "good day":{...},
    "how are you":{...}
}`

Python: `myArray = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25];`

## Dictionary syntax
JavaScript: `var myDict = {"Name": "Scott", "State": "TX"};`

Python: `myDict = {"Name": "Scott", "State": "TX"};`
