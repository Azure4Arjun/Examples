# Examples
My code samples and scripts that I use to hopefully save time in the future. Some may be wrong, as they might represent "what I knew at the time"!

## Array syntax
### JavaScript: 
// Basic:\
`var myArray = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25];`

// Nested
~~~
var nested = {
    "hello":{
        "english":"hello",
        "french":"bonjour",
        "portuguese":"ola"
    },
    "good day":{...},
    "how are you":{...}
}
~~~

// Maps 
~~~
var nums = [4, 9, 16, 25];
var x = nums.map(Math.sqrt)
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = x;
~~~
>> 2,3,4,5

### Python: 
`myArray = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25];`

## Dictionary syntax
### JavaScript
// Note: In JavaScript, dict and "object" are interchangeable\
// Most people typically refer to these as objects in JS\
`var myDict = {"Name": "Scott", "State": "TX"};`

### Python:
\# Just plain dictionaries in Python
`myDict = {"Name": "Scott", "State": "TX"};`
