If you have Visio 2, it includes the Azure stencils already
* File -> New -> Templates -> Network -> Azure

If you have Visio 1, you have to "go the hard way"
1. Download [the Azure Icons pack from Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=41937) and extract to a new directory
2. Browse to `Documents\My Shapes` folder
3. Cut and paste the Azure Icons into this folder
4. Clone [Sandro "The Great" Periera's Azure icons repo](https://github.com/sandroasp/Microsoft-Integration-and-Azure-Stencils-Pack-for-Visio) into the same folder
  * `git clone https://github.com/sandroasp/Microsoft-Integration-and-Azure-Stencils-Pack-for-Visio'
5. Clone [Azure Kid's Visio stenciles](https://github.com/azurekid/Azure-Stencils) in the `My Shapes` folder
  * `git clone https://github.com/azurekid/Azure-Stencils`
6. Launch Visio and add these via More Shapes
