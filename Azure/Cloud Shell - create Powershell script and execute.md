# To create a script file for use whenever you log into Cloud Shell
1. Launch Cloud Shell and choose Powershell
2. Launch the editor (the two curly braces)
3. Write your script, save, and close the editor
4. In Cloud Shell, execute "ls" - you will see your file. It's unusable as is though - you cannot execute it yet
5. cd $HOME
6. ".\Myfile.ps1"

That's it - you have to cd to $HOME to execute.
