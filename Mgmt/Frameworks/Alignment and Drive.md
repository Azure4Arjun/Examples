# V2MOM
[Mark Benihoff's Salesforce company alignment mnemonic](https://www.salesforce.com/blog/2013/04/how-to-create-alignment-within-your-company.html) - 
- Vision— what do you want to achieve?
- Values — what’s important to you?
- Methods — how do you get it?
- Obstacles — what is preventing you from being successful?
- Measures — how do you know you have it?
